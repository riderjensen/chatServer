# Chat Server

<p>This is work done by Rider Jensen on a chat server. This server should include a number of things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User logins</li>
  <li>Chat functionality</li>
  <li>Back end support</li>
  <li>A database to record messages</li>
  <li>Chat rooms to seperate conversations</li>
</ul>
  
  <p>This is a long term project where things will be added over time. There are major changes still needed:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Alert Duplicate User</li>
  <li>Section off chat rooms to only people allowed</li>
  <li>Email verification</li>
<li>User upload image for themselves</li>
<li>Update the HTML on the first page</li>
<li>Force an auto refresh when someone adds a chat room</li>
<li>Have image thumbnails show/play videos in the app</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This will be a growing list of things. Also check git commits for things done and to do lists</p>
  
  <p>If you are seeing this then that is a problem because this is a private repository. Please stop going through my files.</p>
